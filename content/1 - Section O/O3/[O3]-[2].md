In the content of this channel, when I mention the term EGO, I do not mean EGO as per general understanding, as of now, i.e. pride, self-image, self-praise, superiority-complex, etc. I am not referring to that. Surely these things ARE a part of EGO, but it is not ALL that EGO is, there is more to EGO.

When I mention the term ‘EGO’, in the content of this channel, I am referring to EGO, as a complete phenomenon.

So when I am saying ‘ego-lessness’, I am talking about something which does not involve EGO, as a complete phenomenon.

Then what is it ALL, that ego is ?

As of now, do not worry about understanding EGO, as a complete phenomenon, as you would not be able to understand, as of this video.
But as we proceed through the content of this channel, we ARE going to dive deep into it. We WILL explore EGO, inside-out.
